  bio: "<p>The Antos group researches tissue regeneration. To understand the biology of regeneration, Dr. Antos is interested in answering three fundamental questions:</p>
        <p> 1. How are cells at the site of injury induced to regenerate lost tissues? </p>
        <p> 2. How are cells involved in regeneration controlled to produce the correct pattern? </p>
        <p> 3. What stops regeneration once the appropriate size is reached? </p>
        These questions are highly relevant to tissue bioengineering and to the stem cell biology of repair or reconstruction of human tissues. The Antos lab uses the zebrafish to answer these questions, because the zebrafish will regenerate many of its organs, including heart and appendages. Therefore, the lab can describe and dissect the cell and molecular mechanisms involved in the fish’s regeneration abilities and relate them to the limits on mammalian regeneration."
