  bio: "<p>The Antos group researches tissue regeneration. To understand the biology of regeneration, Dr. Antos is interested in answering three fundamental questions:</p>
        <p> 1. How are cells at the site of injury induced to regenerate lost tissues? </p>
        <p> 2. How are cells involved in regeneration controlled to produce the correct pattern? </p>
        <p> 3. What stops regeneration once the appropriate size is reached? </p>
        These questions are highly relevant to tissue bioengineering and to the stem cell biology of repair or reconstruction of human tissues. The Antos lab uses the zebrafish to answer these questions, because the zebrafish will regenerate many of its organs, including heart and appendages. Therefore, the lab can describe and dissect the cell and molecular mechanisms involved in the fish’s regeneration abilities and relate them to the limits on mammalian regeneration."

  bio: "Dr. Dong is Professor and Director of the Institute for Immunology and Dean of the School of Medicine at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Dr. Dong served as a Professor of Immunology and the Director of the Center for inflammation and Cancer at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center before his current position. Dr. Dong’s research is to understand the molecular mechanisms whereby immune and inflammatory responses are normally regulated, and to apply this knowledge to the understanding and treatment of autoimmunity and allergy disorders as well as cancer. The work from Dr. Dong’s group has led to the discoveries of Th17 and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell subsets in the immune system and elucidation of their biological and pathological functions. His group has also helped to characterize the function of IL-17 and B7-butyrophilin family members in the immune system. Dr. Dong has over 190 publications and was rated highly cited researcher by Thomson Reuters in 2014, 2015 and 2016."

  bio: "The main research interest of my laboratory focuses on the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying self-renewal, migration and differentiation of normal and cancer stem cells. Stem cells yield promise for regenerative medicine but also pose huge challenges. It remains uncertain how to inhibit stem-cell-derived tumor formation without harming normal stem cells. It is likewise unclear how directional stem cell migration, a critical step in tissue regeneration, is orchestrated. Using newly-established or previously-unexplored stem cell models in Drosophila, we employ a convergence of fly genetics, cell biology, biochemistry and in vivo imaging to investigate a few fundamental questions: 1) How normal stem cells within a specific tissue are maintained and how to distinguish normal from cancer stem cells? 2) During normal development and upon tissue injury, how guidance cues may be converted into physical movement of stem cells in a timely and directional manner? Since the fundamental principles we unravel using the relatively simple Drosophila stem cell models are likely to be conserved in mammals, our studies promise to provide new insights into anti-cancer therapy and regenerative medicine."

  bio: "Dr. Wang is a recipient of Singapore National Academy of Science Young Scientist Award (2008) and National Research Foundation (NRF) Research Fellowship (2009). The choice of self-renewal versus differentiation is a fundamental issue in stem cell and cancer biology. Recently, Drosophila melanogaster neural stem cells, larval brain neuroblasts, were emerged as an excellent model for study stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis. We are focused on identifying brain tumor suppressors and underlying mechanisms by which they prevent tumor formation in larval brains. Currently, we are interested in addressing the following key questions: What mutations trigger neural stem cells to become cancer stem cells? How asymmetric divisions of neural stem cells are regulated? What are the mechanisms that prevent more mature cells from dedifferentiating back into neural stem cells?"

  bio: "My research group is mainly interested in the genetics and bioengineering of the extremely halophilic Archaea (Haloarchaea) & thermophilic Bacteria. Haloarchaea belong to the family Halobacteriaceae. They require high salt concentrations for optimal growth, and are normally found in salt lakes, sea salterns and other hypersaline environments. We are particularly interested in the DNA replication, gene expression regulation, genetic manipulation and bioengineering in the extremely halophilic Archaea. We also work with a thermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, as an important reference system in our research of archaeal genetics. 
<br>Our current research projects including: 1) Replication mechanism and genetic manipulation of Haloarchaea; 2) Replication mechanism and heat adaptation of thermophilic bacteria; 3) Regulation of stress-induced gene expression in Haloarchaea; 4) Molecular biology of halocins, the protein antibiotics from Haloarchaea; 5) Biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) in Haloarchaea. These projects were funded by grants from the Ministry of Science & Technology of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences."

        <br>Dr. Xue has published extensively on computational studies of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including developing novel GPS (Group-based Prediction System) series algorithms, studying several new PTMs (eg., epigenetic modifications), constructing easy-to-use softwares and databases, and proteome-wide analysis of PTMs substrates, etc. His group is currently combining systems biology, bioinformatics, and molecular & cellular biology approaches to study genetic variations that potentially influence protein modification status.
        <br>Dr. Xue is an academic Editor of PLoS ONE, and an associate Editor of BMC Genomics. He is also an active blogger for ScienceNet (In Chinese, http://blog.sciencenet.cn/u/DaCaiNiao) . He is quite active on pushing the communication and collaboration of young bioinformatists in China.
        <br>Dr. Xue hope to resolve ALL computational problems for PTMs, but perhaps this aim might not be realized until his retirement. Thus, any collaborations, discussions and communications from all aspects including experimentalists and bioinformatists are warming welcome.
        <br>The most favorable word for Dr. Xue is from Steven Wright, an American comedian and writer: \"If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the precipitate\"."
